# TaxRatesSpringBootApplication

This is a project of SpringBoot Application using Eclipse IDE - version 2022-06 (4.24.0).
This document reports the steps of the development and how to run it.


#### Technologies

- Springboot - framework for dependency injection and inversion of control
- Java 17
- Web Tools - for HTML pages editing
- H2 - lightweight Java database
- JPA
- JSON
- Lombok - annotations library for standard Java code like getters/setters, etc.
- Thymeleaf - server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments
- Bootstrap - version 5.2.0


#### Setting up the environment


##### Installing Spring Boot in Eclipse

- Open eclipse
- Menu Help â†’ Eclipse Marketplace
- Search and install:
  - Spring boot
  - Web Tools - for .html files
<br/>
<br/>

##### Running the Application

- Open the project on Eclipse.
- Right-click the project folder and run the application as a Spring Boot App.
- Access http://localhost:8081/
<br/>
<br/>


##### Accessing H2 Database

- Once the application is running, access: http://localhost:8081/h2/
- JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:file:~/Municipalities
- User name: sa 
- Password: (not required)
<br/>
<br/>

  
#### Project Structure


##### Entities

- Municipality: represents a Municipality (e.g. Copenhagen)
- TaxRate: holds information about a single tax record, including the scheduled dates, rate value, and the municipality to which the tax applies. Multiple TaxRate entries can be applied to a municipality.
<br/>
<br/>


##### Repositories

- MunicipalityRepository: repository interface for retrieving and managing Municipality records.
- TaxRateRepository: repository interface for retrieving and managing TaxRate records associated with a given municipality.
<br/>
<br/>


##### Services

- MunicipalityService: manages transactions and core functionalities involving the MunicipalityRepository.
- TaxRateService: manages transactions and core functionalities involving the TaxRateRepository.
- TaxRateRetrieveService: retrieves the tax rates associated with a municipality.
<br/>
<br/>


##### Controllers

- MunicipalityController:  defines REST endpoints that interact with the MunicipalityService to manage municipality-related operations.
- TaxRateController:  defines REST endpoints that interact with TaxRateService and MunicipalityService to manage the association between tax rates and municipalities, as well as perform operations related to tax rates.
- TaxRateRetrieveController: coordinates with TaxRateRetrieveService and MunicipalityService to retrieve tax rates for a specific municipality.
<br/>
<br/>


##### DataLoader.java

- Location: `src/main/java/com/example/spring/boot`
- DataLoader is a Spring component that populates the database with initial data when it is empty, allowing the application to run properly.
<br/>
<br/>


##### Thymeleaf Templates

Thymeleaf templates are standard HTML files (with a .html extension) that can be used both in web browsers and within web applications.
By default, they are located in the `src/main/resources/templates/` directory, and Spring Boot automatically detects and renders them as needed.
<br/>
<br/>


#### JUnit Tests

##### TaxRateServiceIntegrationTest.java

Validates the transactional behavior of `TaxRateService` in coordination with `TaxRateRepository`.
<br/>
<br/>


##### TaxRateRetrieveServiceTest.java

Tests whether `TaxRateRetrieveService` returns the expected rate values for a given municipality and date.
<br/>
<br/>
